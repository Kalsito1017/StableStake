## 📖 About

**DeFi-StableCoin** is a fully decentralized stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. It leverages smart contracts and decentralized oracles to issue and maintain a stable digital asset, reducing reliance on centralized entities. The protocol is designed to be composable, secure, and transparent — ideal for DeFi applications.

### 🏗️ Core Components

- **🔗 Smart Contracts:** Self-executing contracts handle minting, redemption, and stabilization logic without intermediaries.
- **🔒 Collateral Management:** Assets like ETH or other ERC-20 tokens are locked as collateral to back the stablecoin, ensuring solvency.
- **📡 Price Oracles:** Integrates with Chainlink to fetch real-time market prices, critical for peg enforcement and collateral health checks.
- **🗳️ Governance:** Community-driven parameter adjustments and upgrades through decentralized voting mechanisms.
- **⚙️ DeFi Integration:** Fully compatible with the broader DeFi ecosystem — enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming with the stablecoin.

This system ensures **transparency**, **trustlessness**, and **censorship resistance**, while offering a robust digital asset that holds its value over time.

## 🧰 Libraries Used

### 🔧 forge-std

A standard testing library for [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) that provides powerful tools for:

- Unit testing, fuzzing, and invariant testing
- Debugging smart contract behavior using cheat codes
- Improving contract reliability via rigorous test coverage

---

### 🛡️ OpenZeppelin Contracts

Industry-standard, secure, and audited smart contract components including:

- **ERC-20** interfaces for tokens
- **AccessControl**, **Ownable**, and other security patterns
- Ensures best practices and battle-tested logic

---

### 🔗 Chainlink + Brownie

Chainlink’s oracle system is used in combination with the [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework to:

- Fetch decentralized, tamper-resistant price data
- Simulate oracle interactions and test edge cases using mocks
- Ensure fair and accurate pricing for minting/redeeming logic

---

### 📦 OracleLib (Custom)

A custom Solidity utility library used to:

- Verify the **freshness** of Chainlink price feeds
- Reject stale data (older than 3 hours)
- Enforce safety in collateral valuation and liquidation mechanisms
